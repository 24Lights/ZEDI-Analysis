**ZEDI UPD**  This contains the sample sheets based on the results obtained from grapher.py. There is a lot more things we can do from the grapher.py file, i have given a sample to show how robust tool it can be


(ongoing) grapher.py to be developed into a stand-alone application by integrating the preprocessing and graphing tools of eda.ipynb
